This project is backed by a case study of '<a href="https://www.icloud.com/pages/0edwYvillxNU1lx_pC9BaW7LA#Gevalsstudie_CDI_Frameless-GLU">Component detection on the internet</a>' [Dutch translation]. The outcome is supposed to provide an MVP for the NL Design System core team, to act as a possible substance of their <a href="https://www.nldesignsystem.nl/">documentation site</a>.

### What is NL Design System?

NL Design System is a community for and by organizations and government agencies, that help and manage the development of an implementable web-architecture. One with their own guidelines, user research and patterns, to help building a reusable component library that is accessible and user-friendly for everyone.

## Purpose of this reference work

To serve a tool for developers and designers to what extent the NL Design System architecture is implemented in their organisation's website.

## Structure of this repository

The development project is devided into different interim balances. In each of these, a certain amount of experiments is provided, to test the examinated approaches. The experiments are ramified in branches with names that correspond to the experiment in the study report and the tracking ID's in the project management system.
